			<h2><u>My opinion about the world</u></h2>
			<p>The world at the present time is changing and moving towards liberation
			<br> , and in order for us to be liberated,<em> Palestine</em> must be liberated,<br>
	 which has become a global issue, not just an Islamic one.<br>
	 By mentioning Islam, we have forgotten that Palestine is an Islamic state,<br>
	 and we must wage jihad in order to liberate it.<br>
	 Therefore, we are doing our duty towards Palestine,<br> and I, as an Algerian citizen, am I did not find a way to go to Palestine,<br>
	 so I will learn things that will help them from afar, and I advise everyone, especially Muslims,<br>
	 to help <strong><em>Gaza</em></strong> with anything possible. Thank you.</p>
